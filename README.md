# Appdome Front-End Test
Welcome!
This enterprise-grade app centralizes multiple RSS feeds (XML-based news feeds) and allows the user to search them.

I got tired of writing it mid-way, so I'd be happy if you could finish it for me :)

## Remaining Tasks
1. The user should be able to:
    1.1 add new RSS feed to our saved RSSs. (See "Resources" section down here for sample feeds.)
    1.2 Remove RSS from the list.
    1.3 Select RSS feed(s) from the list in the sidebar and display the RSS content in the main panel. 
        1.3.1 Display the title, date and the content of the RSS feed item.
        1.3.2 If the user select multiple feeds - need to displayed them all, sorted by date.
    1.4 Search throw the content. The results should be shown as you type. 

- Please complete these tasks in their order here.

- Using RxJS is an advantage.

- No need to write tests.

## Additional features
These are some more features I'd like to add.
1. Search on multiple feeds. The combined results should be sorted by date.
2. Save the user's feeds and selections after refresh. 

## Resources
This app uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/categories).

You can convert RSS feeds to JSON using `https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json?rss_url=[URL]`
